All Phynodes are in receive mode.
The Gateway then sends a specific byte sequence for synchronisation: {7, 0x55, 0x10, 0x55, 0x10, 0x00}.
The PhyNodes are listening for this specific sequence, if anything else is received, they just keep listening.
Once the sync sequence is received, the PhyNodes start gathering and sending data. 
Each node collects and sends data roughly each second.
Time-devision multiplexing is used. The time a node sends the data depends on its ID (node 1 sends the data first, then node 2 ...).
The data from all sensors is send in JSON format as a string.

After sending the sync sequence the gateway goes into receive mode. 
All data that is received is then saved into a logfile together with a timestamp and the RSSI.

The gateway can have up to 4 transcievers which can be used at the same time.

Usage: ./SFBGateway.app [-1 <channel>] [-2 <channel>] [-3 <channel>] [-4 <channel>] [-f <filename>] [-s]
        <channel>: 0-17
        -f <filename>: logfile name. Module name and ending will be added automatically (e.g. <filename>_M1.txt)
        -s: Single logfile. Don't use seperate logfiles for each module.
        -h: Show this help.
